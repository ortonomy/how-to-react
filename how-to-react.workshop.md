# How to React (.js)

## Outline 

### Aim
In this workshop, we'll go through a quick how-to guide to building a foundational framework for a _real, useful, production standard_ front-end app with and then fill it with real data.


### Learning outcomes
- Be able to create your first ``react.js`` app.
- Be able to store you app state using ``redux`` and integrate into your react app using ``react-redux``
- Be able to 'hydrate', or fill, your app state store with data from an external source like an API

### Pre-requisites
You must have an understanding of javascript and programming concepts such as:
- first-class functions
- ES6 ( arrow functions, object rest spread operators, classes, ``import`` & ``export`` in ``node.js``, promises, and decorators)

You must have these pacakges installed on your computer (preferably from Homebrew with write access):

- ``node``
- ``npm``


## Content

### Part 1 -- A simple react app

Install ``create-react-app``, create an app, and run it:

- ``mkdir ~/apps`` (change this to whatever you want)
- ``create-react-app [your-app-name]`` -- change ``[your-app-name]`` to whatever you want
- ``cd [your-app-name] && npm start``
